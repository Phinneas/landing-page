#### dOrg is a self-organized developer community that wills software into existence.

We are a cooperative of freelancers building tools for distributed organizations. We make ecosystem partnerships and execute on work that advances the open-source DAO ecosystem.

###### How we do it.

Our freelancer co-op rests on two core technologies:

- _DAOstack:_ We conduct 100% of our operations and governance
  through [our own Dao](https://alchemy.daostack.io).
- _Blockchain Based LLC:_ Our DAO is a legally registered [Vermont BBLLC](https://legislature.vermont.gov/statutes/section/11/025/04173).

#### F.A.Q.

###### What&apos;s a DAO?

A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is an entity whose
bylaws are self-enforcing. Because DAOs run exactly as programmed
without human operators, participants can avoid bureaucracy and focus
on the tasks at hand.

###### Who needs a DAO?

Any group that needs to allocate resources, make decisions and govern
itself in a manner that is:

- Cheap → bureaucracy-free
- Secure → resilient to bad actors
- Scalable → effective at scale
- Dynamic → fully programmable
- Borderless → jurisdiction agnostic
- Transparent → easy to audit
